QC pipeline to be implemented:
213 GWAS quality control. We removed variants that did not overlap between the two versions of the chip, 
214 had missingness > 5%, a significant difference in call rate between cases and controls (P < 1x10-?5), 
215 deviated from Hardy-?Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls (P < 1x10-?5), or that were affected by a 
216 genotyping batch effect (significant association [P < 1x10-?5] between an outlier group of cases discovered 
217 using principal component analysis [PC1 < -?0.005], and the remainder of the samples). We then removed 
218 samples with missingness > 1%, heterozygosity ±3 standard deviations from the mean, mismatch 
219 between reported and genotypic sex, first-?degree relatives or closer (kinship coefficient > 0.177), and 
220 non-?European samples identified through principal component analysis with HapMap3 populations. After 
221 quality control, data were available for 4,474 Crohn’s disease, 4,173 ulcerative colitis, 592 IBD-? 
222 unclassified cases and 9,500 controls for 296,203 variants.
