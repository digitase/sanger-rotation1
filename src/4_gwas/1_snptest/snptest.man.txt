OPTIONS:
INPUT OPTIONS:
              -assume_chromosome <a>: Treat each SNP whose chromosome cannot be determined as though it lies on the spec-
                                      ified chromosome.  Defaults to "NA".
                    -data <a> <b>...: specify data files for analysis in .gen and .sample pairs. Automatic detection of 
                                      .gz files.
                 -genotype_field <a>: name of field to use from VCF file.
     -genotype_probability_scale <a>: Specify a scale to use when interpreting probability data in input files. Possible
                                      choices are "identity" or "phred", which treats probability data as phred-scaled. 
                                      Defaults to "identity".
        -haploid_genotype_coding <a>: Specify whether haploid samples (e.g. males on the non-pseudoautosomal region of t-
                                      he X chromosome) are coded as heterozygotes ("het") or homozygotes ("hom").
                   -missing_code <a>: missing code(s) for covariates and phenotypes. This can be a comma-separated list 
                                      of string values.  Defaults to "NA".
               -total_prob_limit <a>: Specify that SNPTEST should treat as missing any genotype calls where the sum of p-
                                      robabilities is less than the given value.  Defaults to "0.1".

                                      d using a command such as
                                      $ sqlite3 <output file> "SELECT * FROM <a>View"
      -use_long_column_naming_scheme: Specify that SNPTEST should name association test columns using long names, as in 
                                      previous releases. When using this option, column names include the phenotype bein-
                                      g tested, the covariates, and the model fitting method.
